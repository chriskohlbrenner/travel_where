  <p>Great choice! All seems well in <%=  @country.name %>, with a human development index of <%= @country.hdi.hdi_value_2012 %>.
  </p>
<% elsif @country.ok_to_visit? %>
  <p>Hmm, you might want to think twice about going there. <%= @country.name %> isn't doing so well, as you can tell by its human development index of <%= @country.hdi.hdi_value_2012 %>.
  </p>
<% else %>
  <p>Yikes, are you sure about that? <%= @country.name %> has a human development index of <%= @country.hdi.hdi_value_2012 %>, maybe not the kind of place you want to be going...
  </p>
